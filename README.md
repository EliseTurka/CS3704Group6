Team Members: Ruhi Jame, Brice Harris, Sanjana Ghanta, Elise Turka

Description of Project FocusBOT:

FocusBot is an online application meant to boost productivity in the workplace. It includes multiple different graphics, including a task list to add/modify daily tasks, a visual progress bar to monitor how much an
employee has done and how much they have left to complete 100% of their assigned tasks, and an inactivity timer, wherein 30 minutes of inactivity on the computer will trigger a reminder and sound.
FocusBot also comes equipped with a manager view, where a progress report of all employees, their tasks lists, and the percentage of completion for each employee is sent to the team manager at 4pm each workday.

Overall, the application aims to make it easier to track tasks and stay focused throughout the workday. FocusBot is mainly focused on corporate or office employee productivity.
